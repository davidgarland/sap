## "Summer AI Project" from 2018

This was basically just my effort towards learning how to make a really simple
neural network to do some trivial task-- in this case, teaching it how to calculate
what angle to shoot a ball at given some target at "x" distance away.

It's programmed in Nim using Arraymancer (for the neural network), SDL2 (for 2D rendering), and Sol (for the vector math).
